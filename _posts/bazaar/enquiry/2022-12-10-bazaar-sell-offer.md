A Sell Offer signifies that a player is willing to sell a specific number of items at a specific price per unit or more. \
Restrictions can be configure in the [config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-config) or by using [*/bz edit*]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-cmd-edit). \
Depending on the unit price, your Sell Offer will be filled faster or slower (the lower the unit price, the faster it will be filled).
