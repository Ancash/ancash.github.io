An infertile category represents an item for which transaction can be performed, like creating a [Sell Offer]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-sell-offer) or a [Buy Order]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-buy-order). 
It cannot have child categories. 
Its' representative item, transaction item, name and default price (the price which is used when no other enquiry is available as reference)l can be configured via [*/bz edit*]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-cmd-edit), navigating to the right [namespace]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/bazaar-namespace) and selecting the category.
